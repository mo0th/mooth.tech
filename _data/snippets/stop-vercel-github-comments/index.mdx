This stops Vercel's GitHub Bot from commenting on your PRs and commits, and so also stops the emails
you get when that happens. This **does not** stop Vercel creating deploys for PRs and commits.

To use, add the following to your project's `vercel.json`, or create the file if you haven't
already. Unlike some of the other Vercel
[Project Configuration options](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration), this options must be
added to the `vercel.json` even in a Next.js project.

```json
{
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

See the documentation for this config option
[here](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#git-configuration/github-silent).

## Example

Here are a few examples from some of my projects, with and without other options in the
`vercel.json`:

- [This website, a Next.js app](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/master/vercel.json)
- [A Remix app](https://github.com/soorria/utils/blob/main/vercel.json)
- [A SolidJS SPA with Vite](https://github.com/soorria/pokelife/blob/master/vercel.json)
