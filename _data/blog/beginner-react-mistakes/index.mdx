I spent a term tutoring, lab assisting and help session-ing the Web Front Programming course at my
university, and I've noticed a bunch of mistakes that many students made with React. Here are the 4
most common issues I saw (and a bonus Promise mistake):

## State doesn't update immediately

```jsx
const Example = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1)
    // What gets printed here?
    console.log('count:', count)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => handleClick()}>Increment {count}</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Infinite Fetches!

This is how I see many people make API requests at first:

```jsx
const BadExample = () => {
  const [post, setPost] = useState(null)

  fetch('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setPost(data))

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

For more experienced React developers, the issue here is obvious, but for beginners it can be
unclear when fetch runs, and why the components re-renders infinitely.

Let's walk through what happens step by step:

1. React renders your component for the first time & the function component runs. The `fetch` is
   called, and the returned jsx renders.
1. The `fetch` resolves, the response body is converted to an object and `setPost` is called. Here's
   where the infinite loops starts. Calling a "state-setting" function (like `setPost`) tells React
   to update the piece of state with the new value, and if the value is different, React will
   re-render your component.

```jsx
const Example = () => {
  const [post, setPost] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setPost(data))
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## `useEffect` isn't rerunning

## `useEffect` code running after the component unmounts

## (Bonus!) Promises using `.then`
