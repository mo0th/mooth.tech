I've spent way too much of the last 2 years tweaking this website and now, after
a friend built [his website](https://ericpaul.me?ref=soorria.com) in 2 weeks and
published the obligatory
["How I built my website"](https://www.ericpaul.me/blogs/ericpaul.me) post, I'm
finally documenting all the crimes I've commited while making this website. The
[repo](https://soorria.com/src) for this website is public so you can poke
around and witness the horrors first hand.

## The Stack ðŸ¥ž

The main technological pillars of this website are:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

...aka the TMNT stack!!

On a slightly more serious note, I'll talk about most of the important tech used
in this website in the rest of the article below, but if you want a TL;DR you
can look through the
[`package.json`](https://github.com/soorria/soorria.com/blob/main/package.json).
