## What and Why

Event delegation allows you to add a single event listener to a parent element,
rather than adding event listeners to each child elements. This is useful when
the child elements (e.g. a list of buttons) change or there are lots of them. It
can also be a bit more performant, and frameworks like
[React](https://reactjs.org/) use it for all `click` events with the `onClick`
prop.

## How

Event delegation exploits a behaviour of the DOM's event system - event
_bubbling_. When an event (e.g. a `click` event) happens, your browser drills
down to the smallest element affected by the event (e.g. clicked on) - the
event's `target`. The browser then <Sparkles>_bubbles_</Sparkles> the event up
the DOM tree, firing an event on every parent!
