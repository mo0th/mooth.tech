How to mock and expect on class methods on classes from `vi.mock`ed modules.

```ts nojs
import { describe, it, vi } from 'vitest'
import { ClassToMock } from './path/to/class/to/mock'

// This line mocks the module so the actual class method doesn't get called
vi.mock('./path/to/class/to/mock')

describe('ThingThatUsesClassToMock', () => {
  it('should do the thing that I expect it to do :)', t => {
    const methodSpy = vi.spyOn(
      // Spy on the class' prototype since that's where the actual function is
      ClassToMock.prototype,
      // The name of the method to expect on
      'method'
    )

    // do the thing!!

    // expect based on the spy just like you'd expect on a mock
    t.expect(methodSpy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
  })
})
```
