How to mock and expect on class methods on classes from `vi.mock`ed modules.

```ts nojs
import { describe, it, vi } from 'vitest'
import { ClassToMock } from './path/to/class/to/mock'

// This line mocks the module so the actual class method doesn't get called
vi.mock('./path/to/class/to/mock')

describe('ThingThatUsesClassToMock', () => {
  it('should do the thing that I expect it to do :)', t => {
    const methodSpy = vi.spyOn(
      // Spy on the class' prototype since that's where the actual function is.
      // If you're mocking a static method, you can use the class directly instead
      // of its prototype.
      ClassToMock.prototype,
      // The name of the method to expect on
      'method'
    )

    // do the thing!!

    // expect based on the spy just like you'd expect on a mock
    t.expect(methodSpy).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
  })
})
```

<Note variant="warning">

This method will only work if the method is defined using the
[Method Definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
syntax, and not as a property.

For example, this is valid:

```ts nojs
class ValidClassToMock {
  // ✅
  methodThatWorks() {}
}
```

but theses aren't:

```ts nojs
class InvalidClassToMock {
  // ❌
  arrowFunctionThatDoesNotWork = () => {}
  // ❌
  functionKeywordThatDoesNotWork = function () {}
}
```

This is because only the first method defines the class on the prototype of the
class (and so the functions are shared between instances). The last two methods
are created per-instance and are not defined on the class' prototype.
