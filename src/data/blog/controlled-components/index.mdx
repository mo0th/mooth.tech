## What are "controlled inputs"?

Whether an input (or more generally a component) is "controlled" or
"uncontrolled" depends on where its state is managed.

**Controlled components** have their state managed by their consumers, and
passed down as props. This means that the consumer of a controlled component can
force it into a specific state. For `<input>`s this often looks like a `value`
prop and an `onChange` event listener:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export function ControlledInputExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  // use `value` however you want here!

  return (
    <input
      // we're setting the input's value here
      value={value}
      onChange={event => {
        setValue(event.currentTarget.value)
      }}
    ></input>
  )
}
```

**Uncontrolled** components manage their state internally, and consumers cannot
easily force the component into a specific state. Sometimes, you'll be able to
set default values, e.g. using the `defaultValue` prop on `<input>`s, and often
uncontrolled components will emit events to expose some or all of their internal
state, e.g. `onChange`. You can also access the values of native inputs using
`ref`s or by using [`FormData`](/blog/formdata) on a surrounding form.

## How are controlled inputs different across frameworks?

Let's look at how the following `MessageInput` component behaves across
frameworks:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function removeVowels(message) {
  return message.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, '')
}

export default function MessageInput() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('rhythm')

  const cleanedMessage = removeVowels(message)

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={cleanedMessage}
        onChange={event => {
          setMessage(event.currentTarget.value)
        }}
      ></input>
    </>
  )
}
```

- All frameworks update the input's value when
- React forces the input's value to match the prop when it rerenders and after
  event handlers have run

### How does React do it?

- It uses event delegation to handle all events that could affect an `<input>`,
  `<textarea>` or `<select>`'s values
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cd22717c274061fd7dc13cd6eaff10e6a3946508/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/events/plugins/ChangeEventPlugin.js#L38-L47
- After all event handlers (if any) are run, any controlled inputs have their
  internal values set to the `value` prop:
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cd22717c274061fd7dc13cd6eaff10e6a3946508/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/events/ReactDOMUpdateBatching.js#L42
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cd22717c274061fd7dc13cd6eaff10e6a3946508/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js

## Opinion time!

Is what React does a good thing?

- forcing inputs' values to match their `value` props makes things more
  intuitive
- not how things work in general
- but react does patch over other things to make things a bit easier / more
  intuitive, e.g.
  - oninput, onchange, etc -> onChange
  - whitespace in jsx isn't preserved - only in the strings you add, unlike in
    html
- this makes things easier, but could lead to people becoming "React" developers
  vs web developers - i.e. people learning the framework instead of learning the
  platform
